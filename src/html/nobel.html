                <h2>Alfred Nobel</h2>
                <p>Alfred Bernhard Nobel; 21 October 1833 - 10 December
                    1896, was a Swedish chemist, inventor, engineer and businessman. He is known for inventing dynamite
                    as well as having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize. He also made several
                    important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous
                    invention was dynamite, an explosive using nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867.</p>

                <h2>The Nobel Prize</h2>
                <p>The Nobel Prizes are five separate prizes that, according to the 1895 will of Alfred
                    Nobel, are awarded to "those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to
                    humankind." Alfred Nobel died the following year, and prizes were first awarded in 1901. Nobel
                    Prizes are awarded in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and
                    Peace. </p>

                <h2>...in literature</h2>
                <p>The Nobel Prize in Literature is a
                    is awarded annually, since 1901, to an author from any country who
                    has, in the words of the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, "in the field of literature,
                    produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction". Though individual works are
                    sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, the award is based on an author's body of work as
                    a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize. The academy announces
                    the name of the laureate in early October. Literature is traditionally the final award presented at
                    the Nobel Prize ceremony.</p>
